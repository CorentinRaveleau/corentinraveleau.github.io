## Numerical simulation of blood platelets adhesion on structured artificial surfaces

<div style="text-align: justify">
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for advanced medical devices within the biomedical engineering field. Given that these devices interact directly with blood, ensuring their hemocompatibility is imperative. Currently, anticoagulant therapies are required to mitigate thrombus formation on blood-contacting surfaces. Recent studies suggest that micrometer-scale artificial surface structuring can modulate thrombogenicity, though the mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet fully understood.

My Ph.D. research focuses on developing a numerical model to simulate blood platelet dynamics and adhesion on structured artificial surfaces. This work seeks to elucidate platelet-surface interactions, aiming to advance experimental insights and enhance the hemocompatibility of blood-contacting medical devices.
