## Numerical simulation of blood platelets adhesion on structured artificial surfaces

<div style="text-align: justify">
As cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of death worldwide, providing efficient medical devices to treat these diseases is a main concern in the biomedical engineering field. However, because these devices are directly interacting with the blood, their hemocompatibility must be ensured. This is one of the most important challenges to their development and side treatment with anticoagulant is currently needed to prevent thrombus formation at the surface of the blood contacting devices. In an effort towards increased hemocompatibility of such devices, artificial surface structures in the micrometer range have been shown to influence the surface thrombogenicity, although this effect is not well characterized and understood.

My Ph.D research project aims at developing a numerical model of blood platelets dynamics and adhesion on structured artificial surfaces to study the interaction between the platelets adhesion mechanisms and the structuration of the surface. This research seeks to enhance the understanding of experimental observations and improve the hemocompatibility of blood-contacting medical devices.
