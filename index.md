## General

I'm a PhD student in Computational Fluid Dynamics in Montpellier, working on the numerical simulation of blood platelets adhesion on structured artificial surfaces.

I am under the supervision of <a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~nicoud/">Franck Nicoud</a> and <a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~mendez/">Simon Mendez</a> at Institut Montpelli√©rain Alexander Grothendiek (IMAG - University of Montpellier) and working in collaboration with Marlene Schadow, Johanna C. Clauser and Michael Neidlin at the Cardio Vascular Engineering (CVE) laboratory in Aachen, Germany.
