## General

I am a PhD candidate specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics at the University of Montpellier, focusing on simulating blood platelet adhesion on structured artificial surfaces. My research is aimed at advancing understanding in cardiovascular engineering, combining intricate simulations with real-world applications.

I am under the supervision of <a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~nicoud/">Franck Nicoud</a> and <a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~mendez/">Simon Mendez</a> at Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendiek (IMAG - University of Montpellier) and I work in collaboration with Marlene Schadow, Johanna C. Clauser and Michael Neidlin at the Cardio Vascular Engineering (CVE) laboratory in Aachen, Germany.

Outside of research, I am an electric guitarist primarily playing rock and metal, though I enjoy listening to a diverse range of music genres. I’ve performed in bands as a bassist, singer, and lead guitarist, but currently, I’m focused on advancing my guitar skills through dedicated lessons. I also climb a few times a week, with a personal best of 6C/V5 in bouldering.
