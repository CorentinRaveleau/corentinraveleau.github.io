## General

I'm a PhD student in Computational Fluid Dynamics in Montpellier, working on the numerical simulation of blood platelets adhesion on structured artificial surfaces.

I am under the supervision of Franck Nicoud and Simon Mendez at Institut Montpelli√©rain Alexander Grothendiek (IMAG - University of Montpellier) and working in collaboration with Marlene Schadow, Johanna C. Clauser and Michael Niedlin at the Cardio Vascular Engineering (CVE) laboratory in Aachen, Germany.
